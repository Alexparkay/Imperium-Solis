# Solar Map Image Instructions

## Image Requirements

To properly display the solar potential heat map in the dashboard, please add your solar map image with the following specifications:

1. **File name**: `solar-map.jpg` (JPEG format is preferred for better compression)
2. **Location**: Place the file in this directory (`frontend/public/images/solar/`)
3. **Resolution**: Recommended minimum resolution of 1200x800 pixels
4. **File size**: Keep under 2MB for optimal loading performance

## How to Add Your Image

1. Save the solar heat map image from your screenshot as `solar-map.jpg`
2. Place the file in this directory (`frontend/public/images/solar/`)
3. The application will automatically use this image in the following locations:
   - Home dashboard (main solar map visualization)
   - Facility Calculator page (preview)
   - Energy Usage page (analysis section)
   - Solar Efficiency page (visualization section)

## Alternative Formats

If you prefer to use a different format:

- You can also use PNG format (`solar-map.png`)
- For PDF files, convert to an image format first for web display

## Troubleshooting

If the image doesn't appear:

1. Verify the file is named correctly (`solar-map.jpg`)
2. Check that it's placed in the correct directory
3. Restart the development server
4. Clear your browser cache

For any issues, please contact the development team.
